   Discovery of Network Rate-Limit Policies in Router Advertisements
               draft-brw-ac-rate-policy-discovery-latest

Abstract

   Traffic exchanged over an attachment circuit may be subject to rate
   limit policies.  These policies may be intentional policies (e.g.,
   enforced as part of the activation of the attachment circuit) or be
   reactive policies (e.g., enforced temporarily to manage an overload
   or during a DDoS attack mitigation).

   Networks already support mechanisms to advertize a set of network
   properties to hosts using Neighbor Discovery options.  Examples of
   such properties are link MTU (RFC 4861) and PREFIX64 (RFC 8781).
   This document complements these tools and specifies a Neighbor
   Discovery option to be used in Router Advertisements (RAs) to
   communicate these policies to hosts.

1.  Introduction

   Connectivity services are provided by networks to customers via
   dedicated terminating points, such as customer edges (CEs) or User
   Equipment (UE).  To facilitate data transfer via the provider
   network, it is assumed that the appropriate setup is provisioned over
   the links that connect customer terminating points and a provider
   network (usually via a Provider Edge (PE)), allowing successfully
   data exchanged over these links.  The required setup is referred to
   in this document as Attachment Circuits (ACs), while the underlying
   link is referred to as "bearers".

   Customer terminating points are also provided with a set of
   information (e.g., IP address/prefix) to successfully be able to send
   and receive traffic over an attachment circuits.  To optimally
   deliver connectivity services, networks also advertize other
   information to connected hosts such as:

   Link Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) [RFC4861] to avoid
   fragmentation:  For example, the 3GPP [TS-23.501] specifies that "the
      link MTU size for IPv4 is sent to the UE by including it in the
      PCO (see TS 24.501).  The link MTU size for IPv6 is sent to the UE
      by including it in the IPv6 Router Advertisement message (see RFC
      4861)".

      Section 2.10 of [RFC7066] indicates that a cellular host should
      honor the MTU option in the Router Advertisement (Section 4.6.4 of
      [RFC4861]) given that the 3GPP system architecture uses extensive
      tunneling in its packet core network below the 3GPP link, and this
      may lead to packet fragmentation issues.

   Prefixes of Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6
   clients to IPv4 servers (NAT64) [RFC8781]:  This option is useful to
      enable local DNSSEC validation, support networks with no DNS64,
      support IPv4 address literals on an IPv6-only host, etc.

   Encrypted DNS option [RFC9463]:  This option is used to discover
      encrypted DNS resolvers of a local network.

   [I-D.rwbr-tsvwg-signaling-use-cases] discusses some use cases where
   it is beneficial to share policies to hosts. *Given that all IPv6
   hosts and networks are required to support Neighbor Discovery
   [RFC4861]*, this document specifies a Neighbor Discovery option to be
   used in Router Advertisements (RAs) to communicate these policies to
   hosts.  This option is called: Network Rate-Limit Policy (NRLP).

   The main motivations for the use of ND for such a discovery are
   listed in Section 3 of [RFC8781]:

   *  Fate sharing

   *  Atomic configuration

   *  Updatability: change the policy at any time.

   *  Deployability

   The solution defined in this document:

   *  *Does not require any data plane change*.

   *  *Supports cascaded environments* where multiple levels to enforce
      rate limiting polices is required (e.g., WAN and LAN).

   Compared to proxy or encapsulation proposals (e.g.,
   [I-D.ihlar-masque-sconepro-mediabitrate]), the solution defined in
   this document:

   *  *Does not impact the MTU tweaking*.

   *  *Does not suffer from side effects of multi-layer encryption
      schemes* on the packet processing and overall performance of
      involved network nodes.

   *  *Does not suffer from nested congestion control*.

   *  *Requires a minor change to the network*: upgrade PE nodes to
      support a new ND option.  Note that all IPv6 hosts and networks
      are required to support Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861].

   This document does not make any assumption about the type of the
   network (fixed, cellular, etc.) that terminates an attachment
   circuit.

   Likewise, the document does not make any assumption about the
   services or applications that are delivered over an attachment
   circuit.  Whether one or multiple services are bound to the same
   attachment circuit is deployment specific.

   This document does not specify how a receiving host uses the
   discovered policy.  Readers should refer, e.g., to
   [I-D.rwbr-tsvwg-signaling-use-cases] for some examples.  Some
   deployment use cases for NRLP are provided below:

   *  A network may advertize a NRLP when it is overloaded, including
      when it is under attack.  The rate limit policy is basically a
      reactive policy that is meant to adjust the behavior of connected
      hosts to better control the load during these exceptional events.

   *  Discovery of rate limit applied on attachment circuits (peering
      links, CE-PE links, etc.).

   *  A user may configure policies on the CPE such as securing some
      resources to a specific internal host used for gaming or video
      streaming.  The CPE can use the RA NRLP to share these rate limit
      policies to each these connected hosts to adjust their forwarding
      behavior.

   This document uses the host/network metadata specified in Section 5.1
   of [I-D.rwbr-sconepro-flow-metadata].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms defined in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit].

   Also, this document makes use fo the following terms:

   Reactive policy:  Treatment given to a flow when an exceptional event
      occurs, such as diminished throughput to the host caused by radio
      interference or weak radio signal, congestion on the network
      caused by other users or other applications on the same host.

   Intentional policy:  Configured bandwidth, pps, or similar throughput
      constraints applied to a flow, application, host, or subscriber.

                        Figure 1: NRLP Option Format

   The fields of the option shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   Type:  8-bit identifier of the NRLP option as assigned by IANA (TBD).

   Length:  8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option (including
      the Type and Length fields) is in units of 8 octets.

      If the "Length" is set to "8", this indicates that only the
      nominal bitrate is provided.

   D:  1-bit flag which indicates the direction on which to apply the
      enclosed polciy.

      When set to "1", this flag indicates that this policy is for
      network-to-host direction.

      When set to "0", this flag indicates that this policy is for host-
      to-network direction.

   Scope:  7-bit field which specifies whether the policy is per host,
      per subscriber, etc.

      The following values are supported:

      *  "0": subscriber

      *  "1": host

      *  "2": application group

   TC:  8-bit field which specifies a traffic category to which this
      policy applies.

      The following values are supported:

      *  "0": all traffic

      *  "1": Browsing

      *  "2": Streaming

      *  "3": Realtime

      *  "4": Bulk

      *  "5": background trafic

   nominal bitrate (Mbps):  Specifies the maximum number of bits that a
      network can receive or send during one second over an attachment
      circuit for a traffic category.

      See Section 5.1 of [I-D.rwbr-sconepro-flow-metadata].

   burst bitrate (Mbps):  See Section 5.1 of
      [I-D.rwbr-sconepro-flow-metadata].  This field is optional.

   burst duration:  See Section 5.1 of
      [I-D.rwbr-sconepro-flow-metadata].  This field MUST be present
      only if a burst bitrate is present.

      Consider using [RFC4115] (CIR/EIR).

3.2.  IPv6 Host Behavior

   The procedure for rate-limit configuration is the same as it is with
   any other Neighbor Discovery option [RFC4861].  In addition, the host
   XXXX.

   The host MUST be prepared to receive multiple NRLP options in RAs;
   each with distinct scope and/or application group.

   If the receiving host is a CE (e.g., mobile CE or mobile handset with
   tethering), the following behavior applies:

   *  If an RA NRLP is advertised from the network, and absent local
      rate limit policies, the device should send RAs to the downstream
      attached LAN devices with the same NRLP values received from the
      network.

   *  If local rate-limit policies are provided to the device, the
      device may change the scope or values received from the network to
      accommodate these policies.  The device may decide to not relay
      received RAs to internal nodes if local policies were already
      advertized using RAs and those policies are consistent with the
      network policies.

   Application running over a host can learn the bitrates associated
   with a network attachment by invoking a dedicated API.  The exact
   details of the API is OS-specific and, thus, out of scope of this
   document.

4.  Security Considerations

   As discussed in [RFC8781], because RAs are required in all IPv6
   configuration scenarios, RAs must already be secured, e.g., by
   deploying an RA-Guard [RFC6105].  Providing all configuration in RAs
   reduces the attack surface to be targeted by malicious attackers
   trying to provide hosts with invalid configuration, as compared to
   distributing the configuration through multiple different mechanisms
   that need to be secured independently.

   RAs are already used in mobile networks to advertize the link MTU.
   The same security considerartions for MTU discovery apply for the
   NRLP discover.

   An attacker who has access to the RAs exchange over an attachment
   circuit may:

   *  Decrease the bitrate: This may lower the perceived QoS if the host
      aggressively lowers its transmission rate.

   *  Increase the bitrate value: The attachment circuit will be
      overloaded, but still the rate-limit at the network will discard
      excess traffic.

   *  Drop RAs: This is similar to the current operations, where no NRLP
      RA is shared.

   *  Inject fake RAs: The implications are similar to the impacts of
      tweaking the values of a legitimate RA.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign the following new IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery Option type in the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats"
   subregistry under the "Internet Control Message Protocol version 6
   (ICMPv6) Parameters" registry maintained at [IANA-ND].

                  +======+=============+===============+
                  | Type | Description | Reference     |
                  +======+=============+===============+
